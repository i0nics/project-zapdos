### Project Objectives
The core objective of Project Zapdos is to complete the development of an application as prescribed by the customer pitch. These parameters include several logic based puzzles, numerous stages, consistent UI & thematic design, as well as a streamlined navigation system.

Here are the primary objectives of this project:

* Create a 2D puzzle platformer
* Develop interesting logical puzzles
* Design a high contrast UI using 3-4 main colors and consistent design elements
* Levels should have a sense of progression by only having the first level unlocked in the beginning and the rest of the levels should unlock as the player progresses through the game
* Game should increase in difficulty as the player progresses from one level to the next
* Develop a tutorial screen

### Implementation Details: 

1. Java was used as the primary programming language to develop this project. 

2. Project Zapdos uses the ACM library for graphics, alongside built in Java apis like JavaFX and Java.Swing. 

3. One of the initial challenges our team face was the integration of an engine that allowed for the flexibility desired to contruct levels speedily, alongside swift testing and design updates. This was mitigated with the implementation of many engine features, in addition to the ability for the team to save and load entire levels with a single click. Another challenge we faced was figuring out player collision and how it would interact with all of the platforms in the game such as platforms, spikes, enemies, moving platforms, etc. Bikram spent a lot of time figuring and tinkering with the player collison to get it to a level that we and customer liked and was bug-free. Additionally, we faced challenges with implementing all of these different aspects into "level creator" in which we could create these levels in minutes and save them to JSON files. Bikram and Vijay worked through this code for many, many hours and through many bugs to get it working. The biggest challenge we faced, however, was as a team and working to provide the customer with a project he would be happy with. The first challenge we faced was building a game engine, but it was not totally what the customer wanted. We also struggled to get good feedback from the customer and we were inexperienced on how to question the customer to get the feedback we needed. Th solution to this came a little late into the project but we ended up talking with the customer more and checking in with with "prototypes". We also had a lot of talks with professor who helped us figure out what we needed to do and how to do it.  

In regards to the customer pitch, our team struggled to perceive the desired puzzle mechanics throughout previous development sprints, though after a lengthy group discussion and coordinated communication with the customer, these ambiguous concepts were rectified. Armed with this newfound clarity, our team was able to produce levels meeting the requirements of the customer. 
    
4. The were a lot of features that were implemented into this game, but some of the most important features were a menu system, stage selector, creating 6 unique levels with interesting puzzles, a "level creator", stage locking, player movement, player collision, player shooting, level resetting.

5. Execute the runnable JAR File.

**Unit Test 4 (reverbotPlaySound):** This test is designed to discern when the reverbot enemy is allowed to play a sound effect, depending on whether or not it has seen the player. 


*This test is checking whether or not the reverbot can play a sound effect, indicating that it has seen the player. Once the reverbot has unseen the player, its sound condition is reset.*


**Unit Test 5 (Level Creator Test)**

beforeClass:  A new baseStage object is created and one platform, one vertical platform, and two reverbots at certain coordinates are added. Next, the stage contents are saved to a JSON file. Finally, the stage is reset and the previously created JSON file is loaded again.
testNumReverBots: This test checks if the number of rever bots that are saved in the JSON file via the level creator is exactly the same as the rever bot positions which are loaded again from the same JSON file.
testPlatformCoords: This test checks if the platform position that is saved in the JSON file via the level creator is exactly the same when the platform position is loaded again from the same JSON file.
testPlatformVertCoords: This test checks if the vertical platform position that is saved in the JSON file via the level creator is exactly the same as the vertical platform position which is loaded again from the same JSON file. 
testReverBotCoords: This test checks if the position of the rever bots that are saved in the JSON file via the level creator are exactly the same when the reverbots are loaded again from the same JSON file. 
afterClass: The test JSON file is deleted after the tests are completed.

### Project Highlights (Retrospective)

The team is proud of the many accomplishments and strides made throughout the development process, including: a **robust** and **powerful** game/level design **engine** that allowed the team to **design, produce and iterate stages/levels quickly** and with ease, complex gameplay features including both horizontal & vertical camera scrolling, parallax animation, tight platforming mechanics, complex collision system, a pseudo artificial intelligence state machine, puzzle mechanics, integration w/ CI tools in addition to many other aspects of the software. 

Our ability to communicate regularly, articulate concerns clearly, update frequently and dilineate tasks were some of the core attributes of collaboration our team implemented and maintained very well. 

The largest struggle we had, aside from few developmental woes (quickly rectified), were in relation to our understanding of the true desires sought by the customer. An enigma to be sure, but with continued evaluations, reevaluations, increased scrutiny and coordinated questioning, this lingering enigma was soon unburdened.



---

### Things To Be Improved (Also Retrospective)

The team would mostly agree, that many aspects of development successfully achieved were done very well. That isn't to say, that these implementations couldn't be improved. In regards to the game engine, our team would seek to vastly improve and implement a u.i. system that would allow the user to import, update and manipulate assets more speedily (introduction of a content browser that auto-generates class objects of a particular type on user import), the ability to scroll, pan and zoom throughout any given scene with the mouse in addition to various other qol updates, built-in user docs etc. 

In regards to the customer pitch, the team would seek to improve level design elements, adding additional enemy types, and working to implement more logically complicated puzzle mechanics. 

Aspects of our development pipeline that could also be improved includes a more aggressive focus on testing implementations, iteration and updates through ZenHub and perhaps an additional meeting throughout each sprint. Another thing that we could have done was do more pair programming and work on improving code ownership.

### Lessons Learned


Many things were learned throughout the development of Project Zapdos that have aided the team to become better developers in both a programming and team environment. Relationship with a customer, where development is constrained to the parameters between which the 'design document', or in this case, a customer pitch specifies was also a unique learning experiences that brought with it some significant challenges in areas unexpected. Our team has learned to glean specific facts from the customer, develop with the understanding that these facts are malleable & will probably change over time, and that software development in this particular environment is meant to achieve the goals of the customer, rather than the developer. Although some of these concepts sways the passion pendulum further away from the development team, this emulates perhaps, how development pipelines and customer products are produced in the industry and so serves as a useful learning experience.

Advice for future 129 students: Make sure to leave as little room for interpretation between you and the customer. Utilize tools such as acceptance criteria to make sure you and your customer agree on what needs to be done. Also, try to keep refactoring as you develop your codebase further. Towards the end of our project, development largely revolved around using one class as a sort-of "god class", which caused us some trouble. Try to find some time to go through your code and make sure everything is written nicely *before* it becomes a problem. We would also recommend to keep the communication up because in a large project is easy to have mix-ups or forget about something because someone thought the other person would do it.
